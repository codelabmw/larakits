## About Larakits

Hello World! Here is Larakits, your go-to platform for discovering community-maintained Laravel starter kits. Larakits help developers find the perfect foundation for their next project, saving time and ensuring best practices from the start. The best part of it all being an open-source and free!

### The Story

With Laravel 12's introduction of starter kits from both Laravel and the community, we identified a gap. While Packagist and GitHub existed, neither was designed specifically for discovering Laravel starter kits. Existing platforms weren't optimized for framework-specific discovery, making it difficult for developers to find Laravel starter kits based on specific tech stacks.

### Our Approach

Instead of creating another submission platform, we chose to automatically curate starter kits from Packagist. This decision aligns with Laravel's recommendations and prevents maintainers from managing their kits across multiple platforms.

### How It Works

1. **Discovery**: We automatically identify Laravel starter kits on Packagist using specialized criteria and keywords.
2. **Processing**: Each kit is analyzed for its tech stack and features to enable Laravel-specific filtering.
3. **Sync**: Information is continuously synchronized with Packagist to ensure you get the latest updates.

### Why Choose Larakits?

- **Community-Driven**: Built by the community, for the community. We curate Laravel starter kits that help developers kickstart their projects faster.
- **One-Stop Shop**: All public Laravel starter kits in one place, with Laravel-specific search filters.
